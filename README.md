# 📈 CodeAlpha_SalesPrediction

This project is part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. It demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to **predict future sales** based on factors such as advertising spend, target segment, and platform.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

To predict future sales using regression techniques and analyze the impact of advertising and other features on sales outcomes. The model helps in making informed marketing and budget decisions.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes features such as:

- Advertising Spend
- Platform (Online, Offline, Social Media, etc.)
- Target Segment (Youth, Adults, Seniors, etc.)
- Sales (Target variable)

> The dataset was provided by CodeAlpha or extracted from a public source.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- GradientBoostingRegressor (for better accuracy)
- Google Colab
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

---

## 🧪 Workflow & Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicates and handled missing values.
2. **Feature Engineering** – One-hot encoded categorical features.
3. **Scaling** – StandardScaler for normalization.
4. **Model** – Used `GradientBoostingRegressor` for regression.
5. **Evaluation** – RMSE and R² score metrics used.

---

## 📊 Results

- ✅ **RMSE**: _e.g., 412.35_
- ✅ **R² Score**: _e.g., 0.8942_

The model performs well in predicting sales and shows that **advertising spend** has a **strong positive correlation** with sales.
